# Notes for this project
Gods we should have started a notes file ages ago.

Okay so what do we want it to do now...
1) Create directories based on the 'category' of the file
2) Change it so that the file that it puts in the 'sites' folder will be put into a subdirectory, and make it the index of that subdirectory.
    - Investigate whether that lets it have hugo-like https://example.com/category urls
